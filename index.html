      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a digital marketer who has primarily been focused on the real estate industry for the past seven years. Creativity is my passion when it comes to my life and my work.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am a Colorado Native- I grew up in the southwestern mountains and have lived all over the state.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love writing, hiking, travel, WINE, cooking and going to restauraunts. I enjoy learning new languages, propogating house plants and gardening. I love spending time with my 3 year old Border Collie, Bubo, and throwing dinner parties and spending time with my partner and our friends. I'm enthusiastic about life and new experiences. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is a job that is high-paying, facilitates my creativity, is not as customer facing as account management, and allows me to work remotely so that I can fulfil my zeal for travel and work-life balance. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the Sloan's Lake neighborhood of Denver, CO.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After seven years in real estate, owning my own marketing business, and working with some less than ideal personalities, I am excited to take my career from a customer-service focused, high intensity/workload environment to one where I can deliver value and be respected for my knowledge. I am creative and have always craved a way to bring my ideas to life, and I believe this career will be a fun challenge and outlet for those ideas. </p>
